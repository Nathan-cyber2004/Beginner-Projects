# Beginner Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly coding projects!  
This repository includes small projects built in various languages as I explore different areas of computer science, from automation and AI to game development and robotics.

# Why I Built This

This repository serves two main purposes:

- Exploration: To try out different fields in computer science and discover what I have the most fun with.
- Practice: To learn how to use Git, GitHub, and version control effectively by sharing and maintaining my own code online.

# What's Inside

Each folder in this repo contains a self-contained beginner project with its own README (coming soon!). Projects may include:

- Command-line tools (e.g. To-Do List, Reminder Emailer)
- Simple games (e.g. Snake, Memory Match)
- Arduino robotics experiments
- Basic AI or automation tools

# Future Plans

- Add new beginner projects as I learn new topics
- Refactor and improve old code as I gain more experience
- Practice writing better documentation and clean code
