# Projects

Welcome to my collection of coding projects
This repository includes projects built in various languages as I learn different areas of computer science, from automation and AI to game development and robotics.
Some projects are more for beginners while others may be more intermediate or advanced

# Why I Built This

This repository serves two main purposes:

- Exploration: To try out different fields in computer science and discover what I have the most fun with.
- Practice: To learn how to use Git, GitHub, and version control effectively by sharing and maintaining my own code online.

# What's Inside

Each folder in this repo contains a self-contained project with its own README (coming soon!). Projects may include:

- Command-line tools (e.g. To-Do List, Reminder Emailer)
- Simple games (e.g. Snake, Memory Match)
- Arduino robotics experiments
- Basic AI or automation tools

# About Me

Iâ€™m Nathan Pereira, a Computer Science major with a concentration in AI, Robotics, and Game Development at UNCC. I'm building this portfolio to grow my skills, prepare for internships, and have fun experimenting with code.

# Future Plans

- Add new beginner projects as I learn new topics
- Refactor and improve old code as I gain more experience
- Practice writing better documentation and clean code
